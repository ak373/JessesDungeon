  reply: Weapons
  response:
  - If you can hold it and it can cause damage, then it's a weapon.
  - Some weapons are made to do good damage every swing, while others are more deadly
    with a critical strike. Some are unwieldy, and others are balanced for a more
    precise strike. And who knows what else you might find out there?
