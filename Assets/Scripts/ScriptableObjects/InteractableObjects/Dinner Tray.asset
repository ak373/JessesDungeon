    textResponse:
    - You see a large bowl with a spoon resting inside. On closer inspection... my
      goodness - this thing is so old the wooden spoon is rusty!
    textResponseAlternate:
    - For better or worse, the tray is empty.

    textResponse:
    - Well, let's see here... there's the bowl. And the spoon which - presumably
      - was used to eat with.
    - You pick up the spoon, and brandish it high into the air. You swing it around
      several times, running battle drills with yourself. "Voosh! voooosh!" You begin
      to hear the sounds of your glorious blade whizzing through the air; though
      you soon realize that you were just getting a little too into it and began
      making sound effects.
    - You equip the Rusty Wooden Spoon.
    - You pick up the bowl, and juggle it around in your hand a few times. Fitting
      your fingers up against the inside walls, you push outward until friction causes
      the bowl to remain on the end of your hand. Extending your arm furiously, you
      repel many floating particles of dust which were certainly a choking hazard.
    - You equip the Soup Bowl.
    textResponseAlternate:
    - You've already taken the Soup Bowl and Rusty Wooden Spoon. These things don't
      just regenerate.
    - ...Is "wood doesn't grow on trees" too obvious here?
