  response:
  - Saul's brother, Chuck, is a bit of an oddball. He started freaking out the moment
    he got down here, stressing about other people's phones or something... even
    though no one had but the clothes on their backs.
  - He and his brother set up a hovel just to the south of here, and he's never come
    out since.
