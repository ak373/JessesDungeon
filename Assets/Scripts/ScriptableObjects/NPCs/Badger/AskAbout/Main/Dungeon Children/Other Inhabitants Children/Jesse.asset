  - You don't know Jesse? I had just assumed since we all seem to know him in some
    way. Though recently I haven't recognized any of the new people... maybe they
    don't know him either.
  - Well, Jesse is kinda "the guy" around here, I guess? No one truly knows why we're
    here, but we're pretty sure Jesse is responsible.
  - Things weren't so bad at first - hell, he actually took pretty good care of us.
    But gradually we began to see less and less in the way of supplies and furnishings.
    Now's it's just a kill-or-be-killed, every-man-for-himself situation down here.
  - It'd be anyone's best guess that Jesse is holed up in the heavily guarded fortress
    down to the south.
