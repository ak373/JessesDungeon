  - This place is the pits, I tell ya. I don't know what Jesse's got planned for
    us all, but things have gotten pretty scary around here.
  - At first it was just the broken crews of bad guys you had to worry about. They
    mostly kept their feuding to each other and left the rest of us alone.
  - But now they're roaming all over the dungeon! Anywhere you go there might be
    some psycho waiting around a corner, so take care out there.
