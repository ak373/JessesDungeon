  response:
  - There were some odd late additions to the cast down here. I don't recognize any
    of them, and almost all are violent.
  - 'There''s one particularly peculiar new guy: Fabulous Fred. And to give you a
    quick idea... I know his name because he talks about himself in the third person.
    But don''t let that humorous bit fool you - he will smash you if he sees you.'
  - But some of them aren't so hostile. There's one guy who had come to do some trading
    with us who dressed and spoke like he was some sort of priest.
  - Then this one other guy who must be a pit fighter or something. Looks to keep
    his fighting to sport, though, and doesn't seem at all like the others.
  - You know, like they're about to gut me.
