  response:
  - Oof. Yeah. Where to start?
  - Well, there's me and Skinny Pete. We're the only ones that stuck around this
    "town square," as it were. We had a bit of a community going on here, but the
    others began to fan out as time went on and - well - as tensions rose.
  - Let's see... there's Saul and his brother, Chuck. They took off a while back.
    I don't see much of them anymore... I hope they're all right.
  - Then there's Lydia, Mike, and the whole of Gus' crew. It didn't take long for
    them to split off and establish themselves elsewhere.
  - Oh, and the Salamancas. They actually were never a part of the community here...
    Probably saw Gus' people and had other ideas immediately.
  - And that strange chick just out to the north joined us somewhat recently. She
    trades with us often, but doesn't say a whole lot in the way of small talk. We
    don't know much about her - and it's obvious she means it to be that way.
  - Of course there's Jesse himself and his girl, Jane. They had a nice cushy room
    somewhere and didn't stay here. At one point Jane started coming around, but
    that gradually became less and less... and then not at all.
  - And I've never seen him myself... but the constant supply of blue crystals down
    here can only mean one thing... Heisenberg is somewhere down here, too.
  - There are a number of others that I don't really know, but they mostly came in
    recently well after our little "community" had long since split up.
  - ...and now there's you!
