    - How exactly do you search sound? Come on, now!
    - Oh this is on me, isn't it? No "listen to" command?... Well we don't have the
      budget to provide you with EVERY command prompt.
    textResponseAlternate:
    - Fine, fine - You search the darkness. There's an elf in front of you. He's
      wearing a brown tunic, and he has grey hair, and blue eyes -- or grey eyes
      -- whatever.
    - Okay you guys can talk to each other now if you want.
    - You guys are being attacked. There are 7 ogres surrounding you.
    - ...all right we don't have the budget for that either. You got lucky - this
      time!
